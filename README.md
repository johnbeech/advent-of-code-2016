# Advent of Code 2016

My solutions for Advent of Code 2016.

Retroactively created in 2018 - apparently I was busy that year. Based on the 2018 template.

## Setup

Clone this repo, then run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Running

To run a solution by day, use:
```
npm start day1
````

## New solutions

To create a new solution, run:

```
npm run create day1
```

This will not overwrite existing solutions.

Populate `input.txt` with your solution input, and then start implementing your solution in the day's folder.
